# Movie/TV Domain Model Evaluation

## Current Baseline
- Model: all-MiniLM-L6-v2
- Dimensions: 384
- Advantages:
  - Fast inference
  - Small model size
  - General text understanding
- Limitations:
  - Not movie/TV domain specific
  - No visual understanding
  - Limited temporal understanding

## Domain Models to Evaluate

### 1. MovieCLIP
- Paper: "MovieCLIP: Visual-Language Knowledge Transfer for Movie Understanding"
- Architecture: CLIP-based multimodal model
- Features:
  - Combines visual and textual understanding
  - Pre-trained on movie data
  - Can process trailers/posters
- Requirements:
  - GPU for visual processing
  - Higher storage requirements
  - Access to movie trailers/clips

### 2. MovieBERT
- Paper: "MovieBERT: Movie Knowledge Enhanced Language Model"
- Features:
  - Pre-trained on movie plots and reviews
  - Enhanced genre understanding
  - Better temporal context
- Advantages:
  - Text-only, lighter than MovieCLIP
  - Domain-specific vocabulary
  - Scene sequence understanding

### 3. E5-small-v2
- Latest Improved Microsoft model
- Features:
  - 384 dimensions (same as current)
  - Better semantic understanding
  - Improved cross-lingual capabilities
- Advantages:
  - Drop-in replacement for current model
  - State-of-the-art text embeddings
  - Active development/support

## Evaluation Criteria
1. Semantic Similarity
   - Genre consistency
   - Plot similarity
   - Mood/tone matching
   - Character archetype matching

2. Performance
   - Inference speed
   - Memory usage
   - Storage requirements
   - GPU dependencies

3. Integration Effort
   - API compatibility
   - Training requirements
   - Dependency management
   - Migration complexity

4. Quality Metrics
   - Hit rate @ K
   - NDCG
   - Diversity score
   - User feedback correlation

## Next Steps
1. Set up evaluation pipeline
2. Create test dataset with:
   - Similar movie pairs
   - Genre clusters
   - Mood/theme groups
3. Implement metrics collection
4. Run comparative analysis
5. Document findings and recommendations
